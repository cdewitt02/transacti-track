<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Transacti-track is a Python script that pulls a weeks worth of transactions from an account and summarizes the transactions into different categories. Additionally, it saves the weeks report into a sqlite3 database. Then, using matplotlib generates visuals for analyzing changing trends in the user's spending. Plaid API was used to retrieve the transaction data.

## Potential Additions

* Plaid Production Access
* Scheduling to run every week
* More analysis
